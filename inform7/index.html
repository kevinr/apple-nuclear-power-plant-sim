<div class="about"><span><p>THIS IS A PRE-RELEASE BUILD! PLEASE DO NOT REDISTRIBUTE! THE RELEASE NUMBER WILL NOT BE UPDATED WHEN CHANGES ARE MADE.</p><p>A simulation of a pressurized water nuclear power plant, rendered in the form of an interactive fiction. As with a real power plant, the goal is to produce a high average electrical power output until all the fuel is used up without injuring anyone.</p><p>Unlike a real power plant, it lacks many of their safety mechanisms, as its original author acknowledges. ('I have some final words to engineers, nuclear technicians, and other qualified readers. ... Yes, I know it takes much less than a day for a reactor to respond to changes in coolant flow and control rod position. Besides, who ever heard of a reactor with only one emergency coolant system, and that one with a limited supply of coolant? And, blasphemy of blasphemies, no SCRAM mechanism. ... Several concessions to accuracy were made in order to create a simulation that would provide realistic responses to simple inputs and make an interesting and instructive game.')</p><p>Originally written by Stephen R. Berggren in Applesoft BASIC and published in Creative Computing Magazine, December 1980, it has been adapted to interactive fiction using Inform 7 in the hopes of making it more accessible to a modern audience, some forty years later.</p><p>The cover art incorporates '#OntheJob - Indian Point NPP Resident Inspector' by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, used under the terms of its Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic license.</p></span></div>
