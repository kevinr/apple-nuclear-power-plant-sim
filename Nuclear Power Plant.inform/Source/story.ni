The story description is "THIS IS A PRE-RELEASE BUILD! PLEASE DO NOT REDISTRIBUTE! THE RELEASE NUMBER WILL NOT BE UPDATED WHEN CHANGES ARE MADE.

A simulation of a pressurized water nuclear power plant, rendered in the form of an interactive fiction.  As with a real power plant, the goal is to produce a high average electrical power output until all the fuel is used up without injuring anyone.

Unlike a real power plant, it lacks many of their safety mechanisms, as its original author acknowledges.  ('I have some final words to engineers, nuclear technicians, and other qualified readers. ...  Yes, I know it takes much less than a day for a reactor to respond to changes in coolant flow and control rod position.  Besides, who ever heard of a reactor with only one emergency coolant system, and that one with a limited supply of coolant? And, blasphemy of blasphemies, no SCRAM mechanism. ... Several concessions to accuracy were made in order to create a simulation that would provide realistic responses to simple inputs and make an interesting and instructive game.')

Originally written by Stephen R. Berggren in Applesoft BASIC and published in Creative Computing Magazine, December 1980, it has been adapted to interactive fiction using Inform 7 in the hopes of making it more accessible to a modern audience, some forty years later.

[UNITS]

[Elapsed time - adapted from Metric Units by Graham Nelson]
Elapsed time is a kind of value.

The specification of elapsed time is "Used to measure how much time
something takes. Inform already has a built-in kind of value called
'time', which counts in minutes and keeps track of the time of day -
which is fine for most stories, but not good enough for science. So we
call this more precise version 'elapsed time'."

[Temperature - adapted from Metric Units by Graham Nelson]

APPLE NUCLEAR POWER PLANT[line break]
by Stephen R. Berggren[line break]
adapted for interactive fiction by Kevin Riggle[roman type]

This program simulates the operation of a nuclear power reactor.  The object is to operate the plant at a maximum average power output without causing a reactor meltdown.

The control rods adjust the amount of heat produced by the reactor.  Primary coolant transfers this heat to the heat exchanger.  Secondary coolant transfers heat from the heat exchanger to the turbine, where power is produced, and finally to the cooling tower.  The emergency coolant is used to help shut down the reactor when other systems fail.  Unlike the other coolants, emergency coolant is not recycled.

The controls are operated by setting the control rod dial and coolant flow controls to the desired settings, with 'set (control) to (number)' (use values from 0 to 100).  If no entry is made, the values will not change.

When the desired entries have been made, use 'sleep' or 'advance' to advance to the next day.

The reactor can be operated until a meltdown occurs or the reactor fuel is exhausted.  The fuel will last about 100 to 150 days.  When the fuel is exhausted, your performance will be evaluated.

If you want to repair damage or replace coolant, bring the reactor temperature down below 100C and shut off the coolant flows.  This will cause an automatic maintenance shutdown and all coolant will be replenished and repairs made.  The greater the damage, the longer the repairs will take.

[bold type]WARNING: This power plant has NO automatic safety devices!![roman type]".
