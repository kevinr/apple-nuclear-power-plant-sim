This is a transcription of Stephen R. Berggren's Apple Nuclear Power Plant
simulation from Creative Computing Magazine, December 1980, pp. 128-137,

It can be run using Joshua Bell's Applesoft BASIC in Javascript emulator at:

or from https://github.com/inexorabletash/jsbasic

(The simulation's BASIC source is complete and correct modulo a couple apparent
typos in the original listing, which I have fixed.)

There is also an evidently-working Python port which attempts to preserve as
much of the BASIC program's structure and appearance as possible, while
bringing such innovations as longer and more descriptive variable names.  My
goal here was largely to make the math used in the simulation easier to
understand.

Eventually I will write an idiomatic Python port, but it's probably not
happening today.
